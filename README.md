# Color-Assist
## Submission for HACK TCNJ

Color Assist helps color blind people to understand what color they are looking at by providing a description of the color as a well as a histogram of the color RGB values to allow the color blind person to compare the color in question to other colors. The app also suggests complementary color that would go well with the color in question.
